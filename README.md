# Movie-Genre-Prediction-
An Attempt to make CNN Network to Predict Movie Genre Using Movie Posters
<br>
In this Mini Project, I have used a Custom CNN Model with 15 Layers of Convolution Architecture,
VGG16 Arcitecture and Resnet Architecture and Trained all the three models and compared its results
Since the Architectures are Classification Models, Validation Accuracy is bit low Since Classification Architectures doesnt able to predict multiple Labels for Single Image but Predictions are effective.

Here I have used Sigmoid Activation in the last layer instead of Softmax in order to get prediction independent of the other classes and Binary Crossentropy Loss function
